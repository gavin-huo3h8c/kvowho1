- htmltools pickup single js file rather than directory

- don't pick up entire package

- shiny resizing doesn't currently work



- opt out of viewer using sizingPolicy (browseable?)
 (createWidget needs to be able to add suppress)


- loosen what is allowed to have history and be exported 

- should widget_html take 'x' (since it's never available in the shiny case)
  (vchat with ramnath next week)

- viewer clear all command
- saveWidget or saveAsHTML function
